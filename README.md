## Official Prompt
An array of buildings is facing the sun. The
heights of each building from West to East is
given in an integer array. Determine which
buildings will be able to see the sunset.
Write a program with a user interface that displays
which buildings will be able to see the

Sunset given the Array of building heights:
[3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 9].

The output should look something like this:
4 --> [3, 4, 7, 9]

## Implementation & Features
- Building Height Editor (change the heights of any building using a really cool build mechanic)
- Building Number Slider (generates n buildings and solves the problem)
- Randomize Building Button (randomizes the order of the buildings but keeps the number constant)
- Building Sunset Visibility: buildings that can see sunset will be in full color, while those blocked are gray + transparent.
- Sliding Side Panel: Displays all information about the prompt

## Graphics/UI
All the building graphics were designed by Estevan Feliz. Link to his portfolio -> https://estevanfeliz.me/
